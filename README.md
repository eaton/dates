# Eaton's Date Tools

Date parsing and manipulation tools, mostly wrapped around the `date-fns` library, with pre-baked parsers for
a number of exotic formats I've run across.

The idea is to handle to/from conversion from known formats, and expensive but sometimes handly "speculative parsing"
and a variety of different formats to find a match that makes sense.
